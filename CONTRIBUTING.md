# Contributing to Axon

Any constructive and motivating input is welcome. I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing or implementing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Improvements for the documentation

## Develop with Github

Github is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Any pull request is welcome. Please use the following workflow:

1. Search for an existing issue or create an issue first and ask, if this issue is valid to be implemented
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`. Based on the type of the related issue  the branch `feature/...`, `qa/...` or `fix/..`. For naming of the branches and styling of the commit messages see also the documentation
3. Handle all `Acceptance Criteria` of the feature- of qa-issue
4. Write tests if required.
5. Make sure the ci-pipeline is green
6. Issue that pull request

Typo's, broken-links in documentation and other similar small fixes don't require an related issue on github or have to be asked, if they are valid tasks. These minor things are always welcome, so feel free to just open a pull-request, if you have some fixes or mini-improvements.


## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Open an issue with the `Feature`-template, where you describes the feature you would like to see. Also add information, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Development documentation

To setup a local environment to work on the code, see the developer documentationand build documentation

## Use a consistent coding style

Please follow the Code Styling Guide as good as possible. If you see any improvements, like feature which makes the code cleaner or something like this, then please open a `Quality Assurance` issue and describe what could/should be changed.
